# Sentiment-Analysis
 Given a message, classify whether the message is of positive, negative, or neutral
sentiment. For messages conveying both a positive and negative sentiment,
whichever is the stronger sentiment should be chosen.

The ulyimate goal of this sentiment analysis model is help recommendation engine to create recommendation. 

## Motivation
- In the past decade, new forms of communication, such as microblogging and text messaging have emerged and
become ubiquitous. While there is no limit to the range of information conveyed by tweets and texts, often these
short messages are used to share opinions and sentiments that people have about what is going on in the world
around them.

- Tweets and texts are short: a sentence or a headline rather than a document. The language used is very informal,
with creative spelling and punctuation, misspellings, slang, new words, URLs, and genre-specific terminology and
abbreviations, such as, RT for `"re-tweet"` and `# hashtags`, which are a type of tagging for Twitter messages.

- Another aspect of social media data such as Twitter messages is that it includes rich structured information about
the individuals involved in the communication. For example, Twitter maintains information of who follows whom
and re-tweets and tags inside of tweets provide discourse information.
